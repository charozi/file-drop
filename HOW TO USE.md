A short little text document about how to use the program and how to install python.

**How to use?**

First, check if python is installed.
Click Windows + R and type in cmd
Then copy-paste this command in:

*python --version*

If python is installed it should say something like this:

   *Python 3.11.9*

If you get this output:

  *'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.*

You need to install python thru the [https://python.org/](official site) or thru the MS Store.

Then if you have installed python you can put the UploadServerWindows.py in your user directory.
It just makes it easier to run. Your user directory should look like this: C:/Users/yourwindowsname/

Then if you want to run the program just type in:

  *python UploadServerWindows.py*

And it should run it!
If it fails at downloading qrcode, check help.txt

Why do i need to type in my windows username?
    The program uses your username to locate the downloads folder.

Will it work on other operating systems?
    I have tested this program only on Windows.
